Uniquid Architecture
====================

Introduction
------------
The UniquID framwork is builded over the **Entities**.
An Entity is any device or system that runnin the UniquID library.
In every entity we can detect two kind of functionality: **Provider** and **User**.
The Proveder send, across an **RPC** functionality to the user.

The functions are identified by a number in range  between 0 and 143.
The functions are divided into two separeted groups:

* [**System Reserved**](Documents/systemreserved.md):  range   **[0,31]** are reserved for framework managment 
* **User Defined** : range **[32,143]**  are reserved to be implemented in the applicaiton business layer.

Every Entity has  the provider functionality (almost for the System Reserved functions)
____

Smart Contract
--------------

At the moment the UniquID library implement only **Smart-Contract V.0** that put in relationship three kinds of entites: User, Provider and **Revoker**.
Are definied how functions of the provider can be called by user and give to the Revoker the p√®ossibility to revoke this autotitation.
The Contract structure is defined ad a transaciton that have the structure defined on the table below:

|Input    |Output                                                           | 
|:-----|:-------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| 0 - Provider Address    | 0 - User Address(Token) | 
| 1 - Recharge Address (opt.) | 1 - OP_RETURN |
||2 - Revoker Address(Token) |
||3 - Change Address|

The order of definition for inputs and outputs si mandatory. 
Only the recarghe address is optionally.
This kind of transaction transfer token form the Provider tp the User and the Revoker and must be signed by the provider.
The transactrion must be considered revoked when the Revoker has spent his token.
___
OP_RETURN
---------
The transaction for a smart contract has, beside the token transfer, defnied an **OP_RETURN**.
In the OP_RETURN are contained the access informations granted by the contract.
The OP_RETURN structure is fo 80 bytes so defined:

|Bytes lenght    |Description                                                           |Notes| 
|:-----|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|
|1|Version| 0 for Smart Contract V.0| 
|4|Bitmask for System Reserved functions ||
|14|Bitmask for User Defined functions ||
|1|Number of guarantors needed|Not used|
|20|Guarantor 0 address|Not used|
|20|Guarantor 1 address|Not used|
|20|Guarantor 2 address|Not used|


The **bitmask** define is a function is accessible (**1**) or denied (**0**) from the **User** to the **Provider**.

___
Identity
--------
Each Entity has an **Identity** that is determined by possession of the **private key** that is never exposed out of the entity's boundaries.
This Private Key can generate the bitcoin address present in transaction.
For each transaction the address must be a new one both for the Provider and the User.
The addresses generation is defined trought the BIP32 standard.

BIP32
---
The addresses generation is base on BIP Standard. 
This way allow the system to generate a deterministic hierarchy of key starting from a **Seed**.
This Seed is generated at the first run of the Entity and is based on a strong **RNG**.
This is also the reason cause that Seed could be cosindered the **Identity of the Entity**.

Below is reported how the BIP32's hierarchy is used inside the Uniquid Framework.

* **m/44'/0'** Path for the **XPub** exported in Imprinting phase.
* **m/44'/0'/0/0** is the point from where start the hierarchy dedicated to the Provider
* **m/44'/0'/0/0/0/0** is the address where is payed the **first charge** (Imprinting). Is also the address for the **first contract like Provider** with change address set on **m/44'/0'/0/0/1/0**.
* **m/44'/0'/0/0/0/n** are the address where send the charge. UTXO on these addresses can be used as second input in a contract. 
* **m/44'/0'/0/0/1/n** are the addresses for the Change of the contracts. From these addresses are generated all conracts after the first.
* **m/44'/0'/0/1/0/n** are the addresses where the token for the User's contracts are sened.


This schema is **mandatory** like is mandatory that **no address can be appear in more than one contract**.
